* If you're not interested in seeing the Build message, run the command: dotnet run, this builds and runs the application for you but if you are interested in seing the Build message carry out the 2 steps below
* Still in the Git bash Terminal, run the command: dotnet build --- THis builds THe Projecta and adds the essential directories to execute the application
